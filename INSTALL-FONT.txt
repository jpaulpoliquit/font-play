🎨 CURSOR GOTHIC UNIFIED FONT COLLECTION
==========================================

✅ Your unified font collection is ready for installation!

📁 FONT COLLECTION LOCATION:
   • Main file: dist/cursor-gothic-unified/CursorGothic.ttc
   • Backup copy: CursorGothic-INSTALL-THIS.ttc (in this folder)

📦 WHAT'S INCLUDED:
   • 16 font variations all named "Cursor Gothic"
   • File size: ~675 KB
   • Single installable .ttc file

🚀 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   1. Navigate to either file location above
   2. Right-click on the .ttc file
   3. Select "Install" or "Install for all users"
   4. The entire "Cursor Gothic" family will be installed

🔍 TROUBLESHOOTING:
   If you can't see the .ttc file:
   • Make sure file extensions are visible in Windows Explorer
   • Go to View > File name extensions (check the box)
   • Look for files ending in .ttc

💡 ALTERNATIVE INSTALLATION:
   If the .ttc file doesn't work, you can install individual fonts
   from the dist/cursor-gothic-unified/ folder - they're all
   already renamed to "Cursor Gothic" family.

   The font "Cursor Gothic" will appear in all applications
   with 16 different style variations available in the style dropdown.
